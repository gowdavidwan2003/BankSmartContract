## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm**: Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
- **Truffle**: Install Truffle globally using npm: `npm install -g truffle`.
- **Ganache**: Install Ganache or Ganache CLI for local blockchain development.

   ```

### Usage

1. Compile the smart contract:

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

2. Migrate the smart contract to your local blockchain (e.g., Ganache):

   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

3. Interact with the deployed smart contract using Truffle console or scripts provided.

### Testing

Run automated tests to ensure the smart contract functions correctly:

```bash
truffle test
```

### Deployment

Deploy the smart contract to a testnet or mainnet:

```bash
truffle migrate --network <network_name>
```

Replace `<network_name>` with the desired network configuration.
